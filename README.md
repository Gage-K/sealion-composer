# Sealion Composer

Sealion composer (Composer) is a songwriting tool to generate chord progressions. It takes inspiration from the design and workflow of [Suzuki's Omnichord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnichord).

Composer is a basic synthesizer engine built on top of Tone.js and React. Its core functionality is to define a root note, voicing, and chord. Changing between chords involves the push of a button.
